Package: fgsea
Title: Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2016-10-28
Authors@R: person("Alexey", "Sergushichev", email = "alsergbox@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The package implements an algorithm for fast gene set enrichment
    analysis. Using the fast algorithm allows to make more permutations and get
    more fine grained p-values, which allows to use accurate stantard approaches to
    multiple hypothesis correction.
